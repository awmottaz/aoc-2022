This repository contains solutions for [Advent of Code 2022][aoc], programmed in TypeScript.

The file naming convention is:

- A number corresponding to the day of the problem.
- A letter indicating which sub-problem it is for that day.
- A `*.input.ts` module for providing the problem input data, which is usually quite large.

You can run these yourself using [Deno][deno]. For example, to get the solution for the first part of day 2, run the command:

```sh
deno run 02.A.ts
```
